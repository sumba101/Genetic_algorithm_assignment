This is just a personal report and record for personal reference
initially the fitness function was set as nothing but only the Validation error and run for 100-130 times
    ( 1 time = 40 requests )
now the top best vectors are barely even changing
the best vectors from this is stored in BestVectorsFromJustValidation.txt
    the first values in it are the summation errors
so i am now changing the fitness function to also include the test error
    i want to do so gradually so im doing it as 0.5* test error + validation error for now
After 100 runs of the code with the above fitness function, we see everything has improved except first two vectors
gonna hit up 10 more iterations
still same state
saving these vectors in file phase2.txt
submitted first 39 weight vectors from phase2.txt

TODO:
will change fitness function to summation of both the errors and run next
