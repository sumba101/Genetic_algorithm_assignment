This is just a personal report and record for personal reference
initially the fitness function was set as nothing but only the Validation error and run for 100-130 times
    ( 1 time = 40 requests )
now the top best vectors are barely even changing
the best vectors from this is stored in BestVectorsFromJustValidation.txt
    the first values in it are the summation errors
so i am now changing the fitness function to also include the test error
    i want to do so gradually so im doing it as 0.5* test error + validation error for now
After 100 runs of the code with the above fitness function, we see everything has improved except first two vectors
gonna hit up 10 more iterations
still same state
saving these vectors in file phase2.txt
submitted first 39 weight vectors from phase2.txt

LMAO one of the vectors in the 39 submitted is THE best in the batch right now
current best test error = 212166.1301339236

Phase 3
Traing on fitness( 1+1 ratio) hasnt improved anything in the top vectors
obviously we are seeing plateauing

Phase4
changed mutation to +-1.5
first running for 75 times
LMAO, massive number of extremely good weight vectors, doing +-2.0 now, god save lets go
bruh should have submitted the vectors produced by +-1.5 first
fuck it, hope for the best
LMAO 39 new vectors to submit lets get this bread
ok phase 4 can be deemed a success now

TODO: 1) submit phase 4 2) start phase 5 (playing with crossover) 3)phase 6 is injecting higher magnitude vectors and playing around with the crossover for that
